**********************
KdTreeProject
**********************

KD-tree library for performing efficient nearest neighbor point queries 
given a prior dataset of points.

***************
1. Dependencies
***************

No dependencies.
Compiled with g++ -std=c++11
It has been tested on a vanilla Ubuntu 14.04LTS 64-bit linux system.

******************
2. Helper programs
******************

To build build_kdtree and query_kdtree type:

    unix> make

Example usages:

build_kdtree
    usage   : build_kdtree [dataset_file] [exported_tree_location]

    unix> ./build_kdtree sample_data.csv tree
          Successfully import 'sample_data.csv' file
          Successfully export 'tree' file

query_kdtree
    usage   : query_kdtree [query_file] [exported_tree_file] [output_file]
    
    unix> ./query_kdtree query_data.csv tree result.csv
          Successfully import 'query_data.csv' file
          Successfully built tree from 'tree' file
          Successfully export 'result.csv' file
